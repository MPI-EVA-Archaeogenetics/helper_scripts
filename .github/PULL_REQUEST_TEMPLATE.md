Many thanks to contributing to MPI-EVA-Archaeogenetics/helper_scripts!

Please fill in the checklist below. These are the minimum requirements for helper scripts.
## PR checklist

 - [ ] This comment contains a description of changes (with reason). What script you are adding and what it does (in two lines tops).
 - [ ] Helper script is in a dedicated subdirectory.
 - [ ] Make sure your tool directory includes a `README.md`.
 - [ ] Your helper script should:
   - [ ] Be executable.
   - [ ] Accept any required inputs through the command line. No copying/editing scripts should be necessary for use.
   - [ ] Have a version number that follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
   - [ ] Include CLI options `-v` and `--version` which print the version number and exit.
 - [ ] The `README.md` should include:
   - [ ] a short example of any required input files, to showcase the expected format.
   - [ ] an example command, to showcase how the script should be called. This command does not need to be a real command, so paths can be to dummy file names.

Once you confirm all the requirements above are fulfilled, you can request a PR review! :)
